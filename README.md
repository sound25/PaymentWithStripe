# PaymentWithStripe
 
This project is deployed in Heroku and can be reached at https://paymentwithstripe.herokuapp.com/

This project is developed using Flask.

I have tried to make use of the STRIPE import in test mode that is supported by Flask.

API Reference
The Stripe API is organized around REST. API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Stripe API in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.
